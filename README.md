# Convolutional-Cat-Classifier
A convolutional network that classifies two cats: Ronnie and Chuchi. It has been programmed in python via Google Collabs.

# Input
This model has been trained with 2 image datasets which where uploaded to drive. It has been labeled with zeros (Ronnies) and 1 (Chuchis).

# Output
I've implemented TensorFlow in order to assess the improvements of the model throughout my work.
